### Third Party Packages

Shutter was relying on several outdated libraries for several years and therefore has been removed from most distribuitions' official repositories. By now it has been ported to GTK3 and can be packaged for repositories again but hasn't been picked up by many distributions yet. The following list shows how you can get Shutter for some distributions. Please report packages, which are not listed below, or errors on [Github](https://github.com/shutter-project/shutter/issues/new/choose) or via our [contact form](https://shutter-project.org/contact/).
