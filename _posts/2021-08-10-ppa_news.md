Shutter's official PPA has been abandoned many years ago, but luckily a [PPA by linuxuprising](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/10/shutter-removed-from-ubuntu-1810-and.html) has been available for over two years already and made it possible for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros' users to comfortably install Shutter. 

Today we are happy to announce that the creator of linuxuprising [has taken over](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/08/official-shutter-screenshot-tool.html) the maintanence of the [official PPA](https://launchpad.net/~shutter/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) and updated it with packages for Ubuntu 20.04 and 21.04.
